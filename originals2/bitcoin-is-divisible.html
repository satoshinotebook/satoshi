   <p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin achieves perfect divisibility - from whole units down to atomic particles of value, enabling infinite precision in the expression of worth.
   </p>

   <h3>The Anatomy of a Bitcoin</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million units called satoshis. but unlike the arbitrary divisions of traditional currencies, bitcoin's divisibility is mathematical, precise, and infinitely expandable if needed.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       a satoshi isn't just a small unit of bitcoin - it is the atomic unit of value in the digital age. perfect divisibility means perfect granularity in expressing worth.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Beyond Physical Limitations</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       physical money is constrained by practical limits of division - you can't cut a gold coin into infinite pieces, and even digital fiat is limited by arbitrary decimal places. bitcoin transcends these limitations entirely:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • each unit is divisible to eight decimal places<br>
       • further division is possible through protocol upgrades<br>
       • no physical constraints on subdivision<br>
       • perfect precision at any scale<br>
       • no loss of value in division
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Power of Precision</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's divisibility enables new forms of economic interaction. micropayments become truly micro, value can be sliced with surgical precision, and economic activity can be quantified at previously impossible scales.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       when money can be divided with perfect precision, new economic models become possible. from streaming money to micropayments to automated value flows - bitcoin's divisibility enables the quantum mechanics of digital commerce.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Future-Proof Scaling</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       as bitcoin's value grows, its divisibility becomes increasingly important. the ability to transact in ever-smaller units ensures that bitcoin can scale to any value while remaining usable for even the smallest transactions.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • no practical lower limit to transaction size<br>
       • each satoshi can be worth more as bitcoin grows<br>
       • layer-two solutions can enable even further division<br>
       • mathematical divisibility ensures eternal usability
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Perfect Granularity</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's divisibility represents the perfection of monetary precision. it enables value to be expressed with exactly the granularity needed, no more and no less, without the constraints of physical form or arbitrary limitation.
     </p>
     <p>
       this perfect divisibility is not just a technical feature - it is a fundamental requirement for money in the digital age. as the world becomes increasingly digital and automated, the ability to divide value with absolute precision becomes not just useful but essential.
