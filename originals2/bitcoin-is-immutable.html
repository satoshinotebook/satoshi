   <p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin crystallizes rules into mathematical law - creating the first system in human history where the rules themselves are truly immutable, forever beyond the reach of power and authority.
   </p>

   <h3>The Death of Authority</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       throughout history, all rules were subject to change by those with enough power. constitutions could be amended, laws could be rewritten, protocols could be updated. bitcoin shatters this paradigm completely.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       bitcoin's rules are not merely difficult to change - they are impossible to change without universal consensus. this transforms them from human constructs into mathematical constants, as immutable as the laws of physics.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Code Cast in Stone</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's core rules exist in a state of perfect immutability, enforced by the mathematical consensus of thousands of independent nodes:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • the 21 million supply cap is eternal<br>
       • the halving schedule is unalterable<br>
       • the proof-of-work function is permanent<br>
       • the consensus rules are inviolable<br>
       • the verification process is unchangeable
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Beyond Human Reach</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       traditional systems can always be changed if enough power is applied - monetary policy can shift, gold can be confiscated, protocols can be updated. bitcoin transcends this vulnerability entirely through mathematical law.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       no authority - no matter how powerful - can alter bitcoin's fundamental rules. they exist in a realm of pure mathematics, beyond the reach of coercion, politics, or force.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Perfect Perpetuation</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin achieves perpetual immutability through an interlocking system of incentives and mathematics:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • every node enforces all rules independently<br>
       • changes require universal consensus<br>
       • incentives align to preserve the rules<br>
       • attempts to change rules split the network<br>
       • immutability strengthens with time and value
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Eternal Chain</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's immutability represents a fundamental break from all previous human systems. its rules are not protected by armies, courts, or institutions - they are protected by mathematics itself.
     </p>
     <p>
       this transformation of rules from human constructs to mathematical constants creates an entirely new foundation for human coordination. in bitcoin, we finally have a system where the rules themselves transcend the realm of human manipulation, becoming as fixed and eternal as the stars.
