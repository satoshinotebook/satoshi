   <p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin restores the sacred link between effort and reward - establishing an unbreakable chain where value can only be earned, never conjured. it creates the first truly meritocratic monetary system, where you must work for what you receive, and no one can print what others must earn.
   </p>

   <h3>The Law of Work</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       in the fiat world, value can be created arbitrarily - conjured from nothing through the will of central authorities. bitcoin fundamentally rejects this corruption:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       every satoshi must be earned through real energy, real work, real innovation, or real value creation. there are no shortcuts, no privileged access, no special rights to create what others must labor to obtain. the law of work becomes immutable.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>True Merit</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's proof-of-work system ensures that energy must be expended to create new units:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • miners must solve complex problems<br>
       • traders must provide real liquidity<br>
       • developers must create true value<br>
       • holders must exercise real patience<br>
       • all participants must contribute something real
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The End of Privilege</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       traditional financial systems are built on privileged access - where certain entities can create what others must earn. bitcoin eliminates this entirely:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       no one, no matter how powerful, can create bitcoin without work. there is no committee that can vote more into existence, no authority that can mandate its creation, no shortcut around the fundamental requirement of proof-of-work.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Earned Rewards</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's meritocratic nature extends to every aspect of its system:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • mining rewards come from real energy expenditure<br>
       • market gains come from genuine risk-taking<br>
       • development influence comes from actual contribution<br>
       • network effect comes from true adoption<br>
       • value comes from authentic market demand
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Meritocratic Promise</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's commitment to earned value creates natural consequences:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       when money must be earned rather than printed, wealth becomes a true reflection of contribution rather than connection. merit replaces privilege, work supersedes authority, and value aligns with genuine creation rather than arbitrary power.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Return to Earned Value</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       when money can be created without effort, the link between contribution and reward is severed. those closest to the monetary spigot prosper while those who actually create value see their efforts diluted. bitcoin heals this fundamental wound.
     </p>
     <p>
       through pure proof-of-work, bitcoin restores the ancient truth that value must be earned, not conjured. it creates a system where every unit represents real effort, real energy, real contribution to humanity. this is not just sound money - it is moral money, where the fruits of labor cannot be diluted by the whims of authority.
