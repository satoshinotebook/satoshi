   <p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin moves at the speed of light - instant value transfer across any distance, unrestricted by physical boundaries or human intermediaries.
   </p>

   <h3>The Speed of Value</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       throughout history, moving value has meant moving physical objects - gold, coins, paper. even in our digital age, traditional money still crawls through layers of legacy systems and human intermediaries. bitcoin changes this fundamentally.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       when value becomes pure information, it is bound only by the laws of physics. bitcoin transactions propagate across the network at the speed of light - the fastest possible transfer of value in the universe.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Beyond Physical Boundaries</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       physical money is constrained by borders, regulations, and geography. it must be physically transported, counted, verified, and secured at every step. bitcoin transcends these limitations entirely:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • no physical movement required<br>
       • no permission needed to cross borders<br>
       • no weight or volume constraints<br>
       • no geographical limitations<br>
       • no intermediary delays
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Perfect Teleportation</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin achieves what alchemists dreamed of - the instant teleportation of value. a million dollars in bitcoin moves exactly as fast as a single satoshi, costs the same to transfer, and requires no more effort to secure or verify.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       sending bitcoin across the room or across the planet is identical - distance becomes meaningless when value moves at the speed of light. this is not just an improvement in money transfer; it is a fundamental phase change in the nature of value movement.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Network as Medium</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's portability comes from its nature as a network protocol rather than a physical or institutional system. value moves through the bitcoin network like light through fiber optics - pure information flowing through pure protocol.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • information routes around obstacles automatically<br>
       • the network is always on, always global<br>
       • every node can verify every transaction<br>
       • transfer costs are unrelated to distance or amount
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Death of Distance</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       when value moves at the speed of light, the concept of financial distance dies. there is no "international transfer" in bitcoin - only transactions. there is no "wire time" - only block confirmations. there is no "correspondent banking" - only peer-to-peer protocol.
     </p>
     <p>
       this elimination of financial geography represents a quantum leap in human cooperation. when value can move instantly and freely anywhere, the world becomes a single, unified financial space. bitcoin isn't just portable money - it is the complete liberation of value from physical constraints.
