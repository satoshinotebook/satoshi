   <p class="intro-text">
     in bitcoin, durability transcends the physical. bits don't degrade, code doesn't rust, and mathematical truth persists eternally - creating the first truly immortal vessel for human value. Bitcoin is indestructible insofar as humankind is indestructible.
   </p>

   <h3>The Immortality of Information</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       physical objects inevitably decay. gold tarnishes, paper money tears, coins wear down. but information - pure, digital information - exists in a realm beyond physical degradation. when properly preserved and replicated, it becomes immortal.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       bitcoin transforms money from physical to informational - from atoms that decay to bits that persist. it is the first money in history that does not fight against entropy, but transcends it entirely.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Network Never Forgets</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's durability comes not from any single point, but from the collective memory of thousands of nodes. each one maintains a complete copy of the ledger, creating a network of redundancy that approaches perfection.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • every transaction ever made is preserved by every node<br>
       • each node independently verifies and stores the entire history<br>
       • the network is self-healing, routing around any point of failure<br>
       • information is preserved through massive, deliberate redundancy
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Beyond Physical Constraints</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       traditional money must be physically protected - stored in vaults, guarded by security, protected from elements. bitcoin inverts this completely: its security comes from radical transparency and ubiquitous replication rather than physical barriers.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       your bitcoin exists everywhere and nowhere - it is not a physical thing to be protected, but a mathematical truth to be proven. this is durability through transcendence rather than fortification.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Persistence of Truth</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       at its core, bitcoin's durability comes from the immutable nature of mathematical truth. once a transaction is confirmed, it becomes a permanent part of a cryptographic chain that cannot be altered without rebuilding the entire history of proof-of-work.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • each block is cryptographically linked to every previous block<br>
       • changing history becomes exponentially harder over time<br>
       • truth is maintained through consensus rather than authority<br>
       • the past becomes more immutable with each passing block
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Perfect Preservation</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin achieves durability not through resistance to physical decay, but by moving value into a realm where physical decay is meaningless. it is the first money that can theoretically last forever, unchanged and untarnished by the passage of time.
     </p>
     <p>
       this perfect preservation of value is not just a technical feature - it is a fundamental revolution in humanity's ability to store and transmit value across time. bitcoin is not just durable money; it is eternally durable money.
