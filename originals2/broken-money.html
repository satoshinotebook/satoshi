                <p class="intro-text">
                    Our current monetary system forces us to run exponentially faster just to stay in place, while real wealth drifts ever further out of reach.
                </p>

                <h3>The K-Shaped Reality</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        We live in a world where Wall Street gets 30% richer doing nothing, while Main Street must work 30% harder just to maintain their position. This isn't a bug in the system - it's a feature. The current monetary paradigm systematically transfers wealth from the many to the few through a process most don't even understand.
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        A dentist generating 5% more revenue each year for a decade still falls behind when monetary inflation runs at 20% annually. This is the road to serfdom: working exponentially harder for a currency growing exponentially weaker.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Impossible Game</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        Consider these real-world examples from our current system:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • A company generates $50 million in profit but loses $100 million in cash value to inflation<br>
                        • A million dollars in savings buys 34% less stock than it did just one year ago<br>
                        • Housing prices rise 27% while wages remain stagnant<br>
                        • Retirement requires 20x more capital than it did a generation ago
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This isn't just unfair - it's mathematically impossible for the majority to win. The system forces everyone to become a speculator, gambling in increasingly risky assets just to preserve their purchasing power.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Forced Gamble</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        Today's system forces even conservative savers into becoming unwilling speculators. An 83-year-old retiree must now guess whether Exxon is better than British Petroleum, or if Apple will outperform Google, just to avoid having their life savings evaporate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The choices are stark:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • Keep money in savings at 0.1% interest and lose 20%+ annually to inflation<br>
                        • Gamble in the stock market and hope you pick winners<br>
                        • Speculate in real estate and compete with institutional investors<br>
                        • Watch your purchasing power steadily evaporate
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Global Scale</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        This isn't just an American problem. Globally, we see:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • 66 countries have already lost their currency privileges<br>
                        • Argentina's peso has lost 45-85% of its value in a year<br>
                        • Venezuela's currency has collapsed 98% in a year<br>
                        • Lebanon's currency has lost 90% in a year
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The developing world serves as a preview of what happens when monetary systems fully break down. Without reliable money, entire societies can collapse into chaos.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Foundation Is Crumbling</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        Our current monetary system has turned the very foundation of civilization - sound money - into a game of musical chairs. When the music stops, those without access to hard assets or insider knowledge find themselves without a seat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need a new foundation. We need money that:

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • Cannot be devalued by authorities<br>
                        • Preserves human time and energy<br>
                        • Rewards honest work instead of speculation<br>
                        • Provides true property rights to all
