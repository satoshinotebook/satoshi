   <p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin achieves the impossible: absolute scarcity in the digital realm - where 21 million becomes an immutable constant of the universe, enforced by mathematical law.
   </p>

   <h3>The Invention of Scarcity</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       before bitcoin, digital scarcity was impossible. anything digital could be copied infinitely, making true digital value impossible. bitcoin solved this through a revolutionary combination of cryptography, game theory, and distributed consensus.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       for the first time in history, we have an asset that is both digital and absolutely scarce - where the supply is not just limited, but mathematically guaranteed to never exceed 21 million units.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Perfect Number: 21,000,000</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       the 21 million supply cap is not just a number - it is a fundamental constant of the bitcoin universe. like the speed of light in physics, it represents an absolute limit that cannot be violated without breaking the system itself.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • exactly 21 million bitcoin will ever exist<br>
       • this limit is enforced by consensus rules<br>
       • changing it would require rewriting bitcoin itself<br>
       • the cap is written into bitcoin's genetic code<br>
       • every node enforces this limit independently
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Mathematical Guarantee</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's scarcity isn't maintained by policy or promise - it is enforced by pure mathematics. the supply cap is woven into the very fabric of the protocol:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • the issuance schedule is predetermined and immutable<br>
       • new coins are created only through mining<br>
       • the mining reward halves every 210,000 blocks<br>
       • this creates a perfect asymptotic curve approaching 21 million<br>
       • the final bitcoin will be mined around the year 2140
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Beyond Human Control</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       traditional forms of money are subject to human control and manipulation. their supply can be increased at will, diluting their scarcity. bitcoin transcends this entirely:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       no entity - no matter how powerful - can create bitcoin beyond the predetermined schedule. this makes bitcoin the first monetary system in history that is truly beyond human manipulation.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Scarcity Revolution</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's absolute scarcity represents a fundamental break from all previous forms of money. gold can be mined or asteroids harvested, fiat can be printed, but bitcoin's supply is forever fixed at 21 million.
     </p>
     <p>
       this perfect, immutable scarcity creates a new paradigm in human value storage. for the first time, we have an asset whose supply schedule is completely predictable and absolutely unchangeable from now until the end of time - a true constant in an uncertain universe.
