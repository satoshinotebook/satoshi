   <p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin is the perfection of money as pure energy - where mathematical law replaces human trust, and immutable code enforces sound monetary properties.
   </p>

   <h3>The Properties of Sound Money</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       for money to effectively store human energy, it must possess specific properties. bitcoin achieves these properties not through policy or promise, but through mathematical law and cryptographic proof.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • durability: bits don't degrade, code doesn't rust<br>
       • portability: information moves at the speed of light<br>
       • divisibility: each bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places<br>
       • fungibility: each unit is mathematically equivalent<br>
       • verifiability: every transaction is cryptographically proven<br>
       • scarcity: absolute scarcity of 21 million units, enforced by code
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Perfect Monetary Properties</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's properties emerge from mathematics rather than policy. they cannot be changed, corrupted, or circumvented. this makes bitcoin the first example of perfect monetary properties in history:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • its supply is truly fixed - no human can create more<br>
       • its rules are truly immutable - no authority can change them<br>
       • its operation is truly transparent - no one can hide its mechanics<br>
       • its execution is truly impartial - no one gets special treatment
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Network Effect</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's strength comes not just from its properties, but from its network of users and validators. each new participant strengthens the network, creating a virtuous cycle of adoption and security.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       the more people who store their energy in bitcoin, the more valuable the network becomes, the more energy is spent securing it, the more people trust it to store their energy - an endless feedback loop of growing strength.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Digital Energy</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin is not just another form of money - it is the digitization of monetary energy itself. when you hold bitcoin, you are holding pure monetary energy in digital form:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • energy spent by miners becomes security<br>
       • security enables trust<br>
       • trust enables value storage<br>
       • value storage attracts more energy
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Sound Money Revolution</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       sound money is not just about storing value - it is about preserving the fundamental relationship between human energy and stored value. bitcoin achieves this through an unbreakable chain of mathematical proofs.
     </p>
     <p>
       for the first time in history, we have money that perfectly captures, preserves, and transmits human energy without loss or corruption. bitcoin is not just sound money - it is the soundest money ever invented.
