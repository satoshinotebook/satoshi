                    bitcoin's resilience isn't theoretical - it's proven through survival. each crisis it endures, each challenge it overcomes, each "death" it survives makes it stronger, more trusted, more valuable. while other currencies and systems fail, bitcoin emerges stronger.

                <h3>The Blocksize Wars</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        bitcoin's first major internal challenge proved its resistance to centralized control:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        when powerful interests attempted to fundamentally alter bitcoin's properties, the network demonstrated its true decentralization. users, developers, and miners collectively preserved bitcoin's essential characteristics, proving that no entity - no matter how wealthy or influential - could capture the protocol.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Covid Crash</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        march 2020 tested every market and asset in existence:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        even as traditional markets froze and required massive intervention, bitcoin continued to function flawlessly. after an initial price shock, it not only recovered but thrived, demonstrating its role as a crisis hedge and emerging stronger than ever.

                <h3>The FTX Collapse</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        when one of crypto's largest exchanges imploded:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        bitcoin demonstrated the critical distinction between its protocol and the fallible human institutions built around it. while centralized entities failed, bitcoin's network continued operating flawlessly, block by block, reminding the world why "not your keys, not your coins" is fundamental truth.

                    <p>
                        through every challenge, bitcoin's fundamental metrics have grown stronger:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • hashrate consistently reaches new all-time highs<br>
                        • network participation continues to expand<br>
                        • node count keeps growing<br>
                        • development activity increases<br>

                        • venezuela's hyperinflation<br>
                        • lebanon's currency crisis<br>

                    <p>
                        while national currencies increasingly fail or become dollarized, bitcoin offers a viable alternative - a monetary system that becomes stronger with each challenge it survives.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Lindy Effect</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        each day bitcoin survives, it demonstrates its resilience and increases the probability of its continued existence. this isn't just survival - it's antifragility in action:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        bitcoin doesn't just endure challenges - it grows stronger from them. each attack validates its security model, each crisis proves its reliability, each "death" demonstrates its immortality. if bitcoin were truly vulnerable, it would have failed long ago. instead, it emerges from each challenge with greater strength, higher adoption, and increased confidence.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>The Question of Failure</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        consider the magnitude of challenges bitcoin has already survived:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • global pandemics<br>
                        • market collapses<br>
                        • exchange failures<br>
                        • government bans<br>
                        • internal divisions<br>
                        • coordinated attacks
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        what exactly would it take to kill bitcoin now? if global lockdowns, market crashes, and industry collapses couldn't do it, what could? each survived challenge makes the next "death" less likely, not more.
