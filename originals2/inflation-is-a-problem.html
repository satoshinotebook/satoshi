                <p class="intro-text">
                    Inflation is the silent bleeding of economic energy from a monetary system - a continuous extraction of value that weakens the very lifeblood of an economy.
                </p>

                <h3>The Economic Bloodletting</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        Imagine having ten pints of blood in your body, and every month, someone extracts one pint. At first, you might barely notice. But over time, your performance deteriorates, your strength diminishes, and your vitality fades. This is precisely what inflation does to an economy's monetary system.
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        When a currency inflates at 10% annually, it's like having a pint of economic blood drawn every month. At 20% inflation, it's like being bled every two weeks. In hyperinflation, it's a daily extraction that quickly leads to economic death.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Oxygen Metaphor</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        Currency is to an economy what blood is to the body, and economic energy is to currency what oxygen is to blood. When we continuously extract the oxygen from a room, we create an environment where nothing can thrive. Similarly, when we constantly drain the economic energy from a currency through inflation, we create an economy where sustainable growth becomes impossible.
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • At 10% inflation, you're gasping for air<br>
                        • At 20% inflation, you're struggling to stay conscious<br>
                        • At hyperinflation, the economy suffocates entirely
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Hidden Tax</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        The most insidious aspect of inflation is its inequality. Those closest to the money printer - large financial institutions and governments - get to spend the new money first, before prices adjust. By the time this money reaches the average person, prices have already risen, and their purchasing power has been silently stolen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider these real-world manifestations:
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        • Housing prices rising 27% while wages stagnate<br>
                        • Stock market gaining 34% while savings accounts earn 0.1%<br>
                        • Asset prices soaring beyond the reach of working people
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Inevitable Collapse</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        History shows us that every monetary system based on inflation eventually collapses. From the Roman denarius to the German mark, from the Argentine peso to the Venezuelan bolivar - the pattern is consistent and unavoidable. When you keep extracting economic energy from a system, it will eventually fail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The modern global monetary system is no different. With central banks expanding money supply at unprecedented rates, we're witnessing the largest extraction of economic energy in human history.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Path Forward</h3>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        The solution to this problem requires a fundamental reimagining of money - a system that doesn't bleed value, doesn't steal oxygen, and doesn't force its users into increasingly desperate attempts to preserve their economic energy. We need money that stores value rather than leaking it.
