   <p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin is a bet on the triumph of reason - a system that aligns incentives so perfectly that rational self-interest becomes indistinguishable from collective benefit. it succeeds not through trust or force, but through pure mathematical rationality.
   </p>

   <h3>The Game Theory of Truth</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's genius lies in making honesty the most profitable strategy. miners earn more by securing the network than by attacking it, nodes benefit more from enforcing rules than breaking them, users gain more from holding than manipulating.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       like the solution to the byzantine generals problem, bitcoin creates a system where rational self-interest inevitably leads to collective truth. it doesn't require trust because it aligns incentives perfectly with truth.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Rational Attraction</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's adoption follows the path of rational recognition:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • engineers recognize its technical elegance<br>
       • economists recognize its monetary properties<br>
       • game theorists recognize its incentive perfection<br>
       • mathematicians recognize its logical beauty<br>
       • rational actors recognize its inevitable supremacy
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Death of Manipulation</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       traditional financial systems profit from human irrationality - emotional trading, panic selling, fomo buying. bitcoin's protocol is immune to psychological manipulation:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       in bitcoin, the rational choice is always the optimal choice. there is no profit in manipulation, no advantage in deception, no benefit in irrationality. the protocol rewards pure logical behavior and nothing else.
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>Selection for Reason</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin creates natural selection pressure for rational behavior:
     </p>
     <div class="highlight-box">
       • irrational traders get liquidated<br>
       • deceptive actors lose energy<br>
       • manipulators waste resources<br>
       • emotional decisions lead to loss<br>
       • only rational strategies survive
     </div>
   </div>

   <h3>The Rise of Logic</h3>
   <div class="section-content">
     <p>
       bitcoin's success depends on and accelerates the spread of rational thinking. only a society capable of recognizing and acting on mathematical truth can fully adopt bitcoin.
     </p>
     <p>
       this makes bitcoin not just money, but a filter for rationality itself. its adoption represents the triumph of reason over emotion, of mathematics over manipulation, of logic over force. those who bet on bitcoin are betting that rationality will prevail.
