<p class="intro-text">
     bitcoin fundamentally reshapes human time preference, extending our horizon from the immediate to the infinite. it creates, for the first time in history, a pure vessel for value that reliably appreciates across time - transforming the very nature of saving, spending, and thinking about the future.
   </p>
<h3>The Extension of Time</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
       in a fiat world, immediate consumption is incentivized through perpetual inflation and artificial interest rates. saving becomes punishment, consumption becomes virtue. bitcoin inverts this completely:
     </p>
<div class="highlight-box">
       each satoshi saved becomes a piece of the future - growing in purchasing power as humanity's productive capacity expands against a fixed supply. patience is no longer just virtue - it becomes the natural state.
     </div>
</div>
<h3>Natural Time Preference</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
       bitcoin's fixed supply creates a profound shift in temporal thinking:
     </p>
<div class="highlight-box">
       • every purchase requires weighing present utility against future value<br/>
       • saving becomes the default, consumption requires justification<br/>
       • long-term thinking becomes embedded in daily decisions<br/>
       • the future self becomes a constant consideration<br/>
       • generational wealth preservation becomes possible
     </div>
</div>
<h3>The Death of Now</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
       fiat money's constant devaluation creates an eternal present - where saving is futile and consumption is rational. bitcoin breaks this temporal prison:
     </p>
<div class="highlight-box">
       when money reliably stores value across time, the future becomes real. each economic decision extends beyond the moment into a vast frontier of possibility - transforming humans from present-focused consumers into future-oriented builders.
     </div>
</div>
<h3>Infinite Horizon</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
       bitcoin's properties create natural alignment with extended time preference:
     </p>
<div class="highlight-box">
       • scarcity ensures long-term value preservation<br/>
       • deflation rewards delayed gratification<br/>
       • immutability enables generational planning<br/>
       • security allows true long-term storage<br/>
       • durability permits infinite time horizons
     </div>
</div>
<h3>The Return to Future</h3>
<div class="section-content">
<p>
       when money is corrupted, time preference becomes unnaturally short. we lose connection to the future, trapped in an endless cycle of consumption and devaluation. bitcoin restores this severed connection to time itself.
     </p>
<p>
       through bitcoin, every economic decision becomes an investment in the future, every saved satoshi becomes a bridge to tomorrow, and every transaction reflects a conscious choice about time itself. this is not just about money - it is about restoring humanity's natural relationship with time and value.
     </p>
